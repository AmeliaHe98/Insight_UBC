 Most of my individual contribution was with creating the InsightFacade class, creating tests and working on queryController with Elad.
 
 We worked together for almost all of d2, through meetings, codeshare and skype, so we both got to work on pretty much everything. 
 Most of the commits are from Elad's account because my computer doesnt really work..
